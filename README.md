Minimalistic client to interface _R_ with REST APIs.

This is an experimental package that builds heavily ontop of the fantastic work
contained in [`gh`](https://github.com/r-lib/gh) by 
[Gábor Csárdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi),
[Jennifer (Jenny) Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc), and 
[Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley).
